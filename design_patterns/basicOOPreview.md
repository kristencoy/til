Welcome to my first TIL. I'm working through the book [Head First Design Patterns](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-design/9781492077992/), and got started with a very (very) quick review of the basic foundations of object-oriented programming.

### Review: What are the 4 pillars of OOP?

1. Encapsulation

   - The bundling of attributes (data) and the methods (functions or procedures) that operate on the data into a single unit known as a class
   - Provides a clear delineation/separation between the internal implementation of an object and it's external usage, while restricting outside access

2. Inheritance

   - A mechanism that allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit attributes and behaviors of an existing class (superclass or base class)
   - Promotes code reuse, establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes. Helps with organization and maintainability

3. Abstraction

   - The process of simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors, while ignoring non-essential details
   - Provides a high-level view of an object or system

4. Polymorphism

   - Allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. Can take 2 forms: compile-time polymorphism (method overloading) and runtime polymorphism (method overriding)
   - Allows a single interface to represent different types of objects, which simplifies code and enhances extensibility by facilitating addition of new classes without modifying existing code
